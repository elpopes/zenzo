# Zenzo: A Simple Meditation App

Zenzo is a minimalist meditation app designed to help users focus on their breathing and achieve a state of calm. It provides a simple and intuitive interface that guides users through various breathing patterns, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced meditators.

## Features

### Breathing Patterns
Zenzo offers four different breathing patterns to cater to different needs and preferences:

- **Calm**: A balanced breathing pattern (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds) that promotes relaxation and calmness.
- **Energy**: A stimulating breathing pattern (inhale for 8 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds) that helps to energize and awaken the body.
- **Balance**: An equal breathing pattern (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds) that encourages a state of equilibrium and balance.
- **Slow**: A slow breathing pattern (inhale for 14 seconds, hold for 1 second, exhale for 15 seconds) that aids in slowing down the mind and body.

### Visual Guidance
The app provides a visual guide in the form of a circle that expands and contracts according to the selected breathing pattern. This helps users to maintain their focus and follow the breathing rhythm more easily.

### Consecutive Days Tracker
Zenzo also includes a feature to track the number of consecutive days that a user has completed a meditation session. After each completed session, a congratulatory screen is displayed showing the number of consecutive days of meditation. This serves as a motivation for users to maintain their meditation habit.

## Future Enhancements
We are constantly working to improve Zenzo and make it more beneficial for our users. Future updates will include more breathing patterns, the ability to customize patterns, and integration with health apps to track the impact of meditation on various health metrics.
